## Usage
### Dependencies
 - `cmake` (build system)
 - `compdb` (compile database for headers)
 - `make` (for running CMake)
 - `ninja` (CMake backend)
 - `gcc-arm-none-eabi` (compiler)
 - `newlib-arm-none-eabi` (C standard library)
 - `git` (to clone this repo)

### Cloning this Repo
This repo uses Git submodules, so you need to clone it with the `--recursive` flag.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://url/to/repo
```

If you already cloned the repo, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the submodules.

### Working on a project
All Setup and Development Operations information is on Confluence.

## Building
Run `make build` for a debug build, or `make release` for a release build.
`make clean` will delete the build folder.

Output binaries for each board will be present in `build/uf2`
